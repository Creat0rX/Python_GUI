# Python GUI

This is my repository where I experiment creating programs using the GUI libraries from python, primarily `tkinter` , and learning more in the process

## List of tasks

- [x] app.py
- [ ] tictactoe.py
- [ ] mastermind.py

### app.py

My first python app created using the `tkinter` module, which displays a button only reachable to be clicked in possible mode.
