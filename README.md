# Python GUI

This is my repository where I experiment creating programs using the GUI libraries from python, primarily `tkinter` , and learning more in the process

All programs are built using python 3, and can be run on any machine which has python 3 installed correctly.

## List of tasks

- [x] app.py
- [ ] tictactoe.py
- [ ] calculator.py
- [ ] guesser.py
- [ ] xguesser.py
- [ ] hangman.py
- [ ] countries.py
- [x] paintVGA.py
- [ ] mastermind.py

### app.py

My first python app created using the `tkinter` module, which displays a button only reachable to be clicked in possible mode.

### paintVGA.py

[IN PROGRESS] End goal is to make a basic paint-like app with only the VGA 4-colour scheme
