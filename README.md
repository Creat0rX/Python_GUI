# Python GUI

This is my repository where I experiment creating programs using the GUI libraries from python, primarily `tkinter` , and learning more in the process

All programs are built using python 3, and can be run on any machine which has python 3 installed correctly.

## List of tasks

- [x] app
- [ ] clicker
- [ ] tictactoe
- [ ] calculator
- [ ] guesser
- [ ] xguesser
- [ ] hangman
- [ ] countries
- [x] paintVGA
- [x] mastermind

### app

My first python app created using the `tkinter` module, which displays a button only reachable to be clicked in possible mode.

### paintVGA

A basic paint-like app with only the VGA 4-colour scheme (saving art currently not implemented)

### mastermind

A mastermind game, where you have to guess the correct sequence of 4 colours

### xguesser

[IN PROGRESS] A game where you have to go through a full deck of cards, trying to guess the incorrect value of the next card

### hangman

[IN PROGRESS] A game where you have to guess the name of the pokemon before you draw a hangman figure
